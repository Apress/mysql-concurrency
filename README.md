## Releases

Release v1.2 updates the URL for downloading the world database and the path within the ZIP file after it has been updated on downloads.mysql.com. Thanks to shalk (xiao kun) for the patch and black-lotus (Dondon) for a similar patch.

Release v1.1 fixes the directory structure, adds missing files for chapters 2, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and adds error message when using `concurrency_book.generate.load()` with the classic MySQL protocol.

Release v1.0 corresponds to the code in the published book, without corrections or updates.
